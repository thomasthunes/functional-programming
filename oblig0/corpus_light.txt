I think it is safe to say that ours is the only dining room in West Los Angeles on whose table -- an eight-foot-long , two-hundred-pound behemoth on which I have taken my meals for many years -- rest piles of photocopies of articles on suicide , all of which were printed in the Encyclopaedia Britannica over the past 220 years . They represent the convergence of two crucially important strands in my own life . Indeed , as I look at the articles , arrayed before me in fanlike tiers , I get the odd feeling that the old oak ruble on which I have eaten so many thousands of dinners has been set not with its customary china and silver but with my intellectual autobiography . My special relationship with the Britannica is of long standing . It is relevant to report that I was a sickly child and stayed home from school a great deal . The reader can readily imagine the sort of boy I was : frail , bookish , and undersized ( I was small to begin with , and continued to shrink , comparatively speaking , as I was double-promoted four ) . Our house , fifteen miles and seventy years from the one in which my wife and I live today , resembled those of many Eastern European Jewish immigrant families with intellectual aspirations . There were copies of Shakespeare , Tolstoy , Dostoyevsky , Conrad , and Mann , diligently assembled from the local Lincoln Heights Library 's list of " The 100 Best . " There was a windup Victrola and records of operatic arias sung by Caruso and Farrar . And in the center of all this -- the jewel in the Shneidman family 's cultural crown-there was the Ninth Edition of the Britannica , enshrined in a Stickley bookcase with glass doors and its own little key . The suite of Craftsman furniture to which the bookcase belonged also included a sofa , a chair , and a table . All of them are in my home today .
